## Summary of the problem
This section should hold details about the problem we are trying to solve and what we have learned from our research. It should take into account the different contexts in which our users may use our product to solve their problems (for example first-time user vs. pro-user).

## User stories
Take each of the user stories and describe this specific use case in more detail and the benefit that this feature will bring to the user.

### Example user story
In the metrics UI, an enterprise IT admin wants to see the waffle map that shows the health and performance of 10K nodes so that they have a birds-eye view into the health of their entire system in a single view.

**Definition of health and performance:**
IF there are no active alerts/anomalies for that node then it is healthy
